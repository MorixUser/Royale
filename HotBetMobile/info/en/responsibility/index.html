    <h2 style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;">How to define Compulsive Gambling</h2>
    <p>
        Once gambling becomes an obsession, it is referred to as compulsive gambling. The urge to play grows so high, 
        that time and money as well as the self-esteem might go astray. 
        <br />Die vital aspects of an intact and contented life, 
        as family and work, are being pushed back and disregarded and eventually make way for the problem of compulsive gambling.
        <br /><br />

    <h2 style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;">How do I prevent that?</h2>
    <p>
        <br />1. Gambling is meant to be entertaining and not as a source for moneymaking. 
        <br />2. Try to avoid spending more money after a lost bet. 
        <br />3. Play only if you can afford to lose. 
        <br />4. Keep an eye on how much time you spend gambling. 
        <br />5. If you want to take a break from playing, you can always make use of our self-exclusion option. 
        <br />6. If you ever feel the need to talk to someone about your gambling behavior, Gambling Therapy is an appropriate contact for you.

    <p>
        In case you are worried about gambling dictating your life (or that of another person), the following questions might be an indication for you:
        <br /> 
        <br />1. Do you stay away from work, university or school to gamble?
        <br />2. Do you play because you are bored or unhappy? 
        <br />3. Do you feel desperate and the need to play again as soon as possible, once you run out of money? 
        <br />4. Do you play until you’ve lost your entire money and maybe even the money for your way back home? 
        <br />5. Have you ever lied to conceal the amount of time and money you invest in gambling? 
        <br />6. Have other people ever criticized you for your gambling activities?
        <br />7. Have you lost interest in your family, friends or hobbies?
        <br />8. Do you feel like you have to try to win back your money as fast as possible once you’ve lost? 
        <br />9. Do arguments, frustration or disappointments cause a need to play? 
        <br />10. Do you feel depressive or even suicidal because of your gambling behavior?
        <br />The more questions you answered positively, the higher the chance you have a compulsive gambling problem. In this case you can turn to Gambling Therapy by visiting <a href="http://www.gamblingtherapy.org/"  target="_blank">www.gamblingtherapy.org.</a>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;">Protecting Minors</h2>
    <p>
        hotbet777 excludes minors (persons under the age of 18) from participating in gambling. For this reason, 
        you are asked for your explicit affirmation of legal age as well as your announcement of your date of birth when 
        registering. 
        When asking for your first payout, you will have to provide a copy of your ID. hotbet777 takes its responsibility of preventing minors from gambling very seriously. 
        Yet, to provide the best possible protection of minors, 
        we depend on the support of the parents and legal guardians.
        Therefore, please keep your login details ready at any time (account name, password and your combination of question and response).
        <br /> 
        <br />Furthermore, we recommend installing a filtering program. Software like this will enable you to limit the internet access 
        for children and adolescents. At <a href="http://www.saferinternet.org"  target="_blank">www.saferinternet.org</a> you will find more details. Filtering programs such 
        as <a href="http://www.netnanny.com"  target="_blank">www.netnanny.com</a> can provide even more security.
