                        <p>
                            The slot is a single player casino game. This game starts by placing a bet and ends when the actual slot application

                            is closed. Once opened, a single slot application, one can start a game session and every game session represents an

                            independent new game which has no influence on any other game as each game session is unique. <br><br>

                            The session is made up from different phases which are called "SPINS". The spins activates the reels to turn showing the

                            winning symbols spinning fast and then stop to combine different combinations relative to the spin which has just taken

                            place. Every symbol on the reel is set by the slot producer. At the end of each spin, it is possible to end the game and in

                            this case, the game session is automatically ended.<br><br>

                            The minimum and/or maximum bet varies according to the values set by the slot producer and vary from slot to slot. To

                            bet, you need to utilise the coins and the value of these can be used in the "MENU BUTTONS" clicking on "COIN VALUE"

                            ("MENU BUTTONS" and "COIN VALUE" are explained further on in this document) During a game session, one can fund

                            his player account at any time but it is not possible to exceed the limits set by the game. After you choose the slot to

                            play, choose the amount the total amount of coins you want to bet, using one of the buttons which are explained in the

                            chapter "MENU BUTTONS" and click on "SPIN" to start the game. If you click on "AUTO", a menu will appear on the screen.

                            This will be explained in the chapter named "MENU BUTTONS". Choosing "AUTO" allows a player to play automatically.<br><br>

                            All prizes are relative to winning combinations starting from "LEFT" to "RIGHT" on the winning lines. On every line, the best

                            winning combination is valid, in case of multiple winning combinations on a single line, only the highest combination is

                            valid and is the one which pays the highest prize as explained in the "PAYTABLE".
                        </p>

                        <h1>PAYTABLE:</h1>
                        <p>
                            The "PAYTABLE" is the table showing the list of all symbols of the slot and their corresponding winning value. For every symbol of the slot you will find a list of every possible winning combination and the corresponding amount you can win with each combination.<br><br>

                            With regards to the special symbols, you will find an additional description in the "PAYTABLE" which briefly explains what is described in more detail in the SYMBOLS chapter.<br><br>

                            It also shows all winning combinations of all symbols and the amount won per combination. <br><br>

                            In the slots one can also find small spaces or pop ups which contain mini extracts of the PAYTABLE" which show the player in brief, the winning combination for example : 4 x 100 symbol, which means that 4 of those symbols combined from left to right result in winning 100 coins.
                            <br><br>
                            These little popups come out casually in rotation.

                        </p>


                        <h1>SYMBOLS</h1>

                                The simple game symbols are defined in this way because they have no special functions and only pay out the amount shown  next to the winning combination which is shown in the "PAYTABLE".<br>
                                You can win with two or three similar symbols (depending on the type of slot) as long as they are adjacent (from left to right) and they appear on one of the lines activated by you.
                                <br><br>

                                You can also find these symbols listed in the PAYTABLE and they are defined special because apart from paying the amount corresponding to the winning combination, these symbols have other functions like BONUS GAME or FREE GAMES
                                <br><br>
                                <ul>
