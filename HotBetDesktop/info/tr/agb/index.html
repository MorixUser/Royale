Notwithstanding that, the issued decision does not change the outcome of the said bet offers at the time of the abandonment. In that case the stakes will be refunded. All other offers will be declared void except for those the outcomes of which have been decided prior to the abandonment and could not possibly be changed regardless of future events, which will be settled according to the decided outcome.
